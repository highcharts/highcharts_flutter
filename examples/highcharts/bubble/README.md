# Bubble chart demo

**Highcharts demo**
Chart showing basic use of bubble series with a custom tooltip formatter.
        The chart uses plot lines to show safe intake levels for sugar and fat.
        Bubble charts are great for comparing three dimensions of data without
        relying on color or 3D charts.
