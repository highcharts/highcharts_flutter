# Pictorial chart demo

**Highcharts demo**
Chart showing the composition of the human body. The chart is using
          the <code>pictorial</code> series type with a woman and man image. The
          pictorial chart creates a number of items corresponding to the value
          and color of each data point, which, when stacked, form the image's
          shape. If the series is hidden, the <code>yAxis.stackShadow</code>
          option creates the image shape's background.
