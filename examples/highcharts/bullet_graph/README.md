# Bullet graph demo

**Highcharts demo**
A series of bullet charts showing Revenue, Profit, and New Customers.
        Bullet charts allow readers to quickly compare a single value to a
        target value. This demo is also using plot bands to separate different
        ranges on the axes. Bullet charts are popular in dashboards, as they
        typically take up less space than gauge charts.
