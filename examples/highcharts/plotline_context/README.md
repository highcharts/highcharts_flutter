# Basic context cues demo

**Highcharts demo**
Here we are using context tracks (tracks that are not linked to data points) to sonify plot lines and plot bands. A repeating note plays to indicate the sound of the 0 level, and a percussive sound plays in the summer months. In addition, the "Summer" label is announced with speech.
