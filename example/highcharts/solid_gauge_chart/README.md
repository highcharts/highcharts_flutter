# Solid gauge demo

**Highcharts demo**
Chart demonstrating solid gauges with dynamic data. Two separate charts
        are used, and each is updated dynamically every few seconds. Solid
        gauges are popular charts for dashboards, as they visualize a number
        in a range at a glance. As demonstrated by these charts, the color of
        the gauge can change depending on the value of the data shown.
