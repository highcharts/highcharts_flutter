# Packed bubble chart demo

**Highcharts demo**,**Animation**
Packed bubble charts are visualizations where the size and optionally
        the color of the bubbles are used to visualize the data. The positioning
        of the bubbles is not significant, but is optimized for compactness.
        Try dragging the bubbles in this chart around, and see the effects.
