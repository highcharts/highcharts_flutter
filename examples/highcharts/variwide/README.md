# Variwide demo

**Highcharts demo**
Variwide charts can be used to visualize a second dimension
        in a column chart. Each data point is given a weight, in
        addition to its value, determining the width of the column.
        In this chart, the Y-Axis represents the labor cost of the
        country, while the column width is proportional to the
        country's GDP.
