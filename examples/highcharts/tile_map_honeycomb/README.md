# Tile map, honeycomb demo

**Highcharts demo**
Hexagonal tilemap, sometimes referred to as a honeycomb or hexbin chart,
        showing population data in the US. In this case the map is used to show
        each US state with the same size - which removes some of the bias
        associated with traditional maps.
