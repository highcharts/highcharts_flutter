# Responsive chart demo

**Highcharts demo**
This demo shows how breakpoints can be defined in order to
        change the chart options depending on the screen width. All
        charts automatically scale to the container size, but in this
        case we also change the positioning of the legend and axis
        elements to accomodate smaller screens.
