# Highcharts Flutter Performance Demo

**Highcharts demo**, **Boost**, **Multiple charts**, **FPS monitor**

Interactive performance benchmark for **Highcharts Flutter**.
This demo visualizes how rendering performance changes with:
- Multiple charts displayed simultaneously
- Increasing number of series and data points
- Using the **Boost module** for GPU acceleration
- Switching between **sine wave line charts** and **random scatter charts**
- Real-time **FPS counter** rendered inside the chart WebView

Use the controls at the top to adjust chart count, series count, data size, sine/scatter mode, and Boost mode.
