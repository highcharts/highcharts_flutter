# Relative Rotation Graph demo

**Highcharts Stock demo**
Relative Rotation Graphs®️ visualize the relation between the strength
        and momentum of various assets against a chosen benchmark (i.e. S&amp;P 500
        index) and themselves. The performance is visualized in four quadrants.
        Leading (green) - the asset is stronger than the benchmark and it's
        getting stronger (positive momentum), Weakening (yellow) - the asset is
        stronger than the benchmark, but it's getting weaker (negative
        momentum), Lagging (red) - the asset is weaker than the benchmark and
        it's getting weaker, Improving (blue) - the asset is weaker than the
        benchmark, but it's getting stronger.
